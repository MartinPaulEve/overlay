"Overlay" is a work of prototype curation software for overlay journals in scholarly communications.

#Overlay Journals
The term overlay journals refers to the use of curated tables of contents to bring editorial selective expertise to bear upon previously published material. In this way, it becomes possible to get the benefits of centralized megajournal production while preserving the discoverability function of journal silos.

#Installation and Use
Overlay is a Django app, so you'll need to install all Django dependencies. You should then be able to launch the software using Django's "runserver" command.
